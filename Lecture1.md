## Introduction

#### Why Data Visualization?

- Lots of data!

- Statistical summaries of data are often misleading. Different datasets can have the same summary statistics but very different distributions. Visualizations can show these differences and are therefore essential to get a true understanding of the underlying data.

> Data Visualization can be used to record information.
